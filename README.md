# CultureLinkr-Backend-Assignment - Product Total Value API

This is a **Node.js** and **Express API** that receives a list of product objects (containing `name`, `price`, and `quality`) and calculates the **total value** of all products.

## Features
- Accepts product data through **POST** requests.
- Validates that the input is an array of products.
- Computes total value when both `price` and `quality` are numbers.
- Returns relevant error messages for invalid inputs.
